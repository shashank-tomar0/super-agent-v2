# VLESS

**Privacy-preserving browser automation through on-device PII detection and redaction.**

VLESS is a Chrome extension that automates browser tasks while protecting personally identifiable information. Every page snapshot is scanned for PII before it reaches any LLM provider. Screenshots are redacted — faces blurred, credentials masked — before anything leaves the device. The agent refuses to type passwords, card numbers, or government IDs into any field.

Built for [Smart India Hackathon 2026](https://sih.gov.in/sih2026PS) Problem Statement 26171: *On-device Visual Perception for Lightweight Browser Agents*.

## Overview

Modern browser agents — Browser Use, Anthropic Computer Use, OpenAI Operator — send full screenshots to cloud servers for processing. These screenshots contain passwords, financial data, personal messages, and identity documents. VLESS eliminates this risk by applying a multi-stage privacy pipeline before any data crosses a network boundary.

### Key Capabilities

- **PII Detection** — Regex-based detection for Aadhaar, PAN, IFSC, SSN, passport numbers, credit cards, API keys, and password fields. Every detection is classified by type and confidence.
- **PII Tokenization** — Sensitive values are replaced with opaque tokens (`<CRED_1>`, `<ID_2>`) before the LLM sees them. The vault is held in memory only, resolved at the last moment before action execution.
- **Screenshot Redaction** — The offscreen document captures `captureVisibleTab`, applies DOM-guided masking to credential fields, and detects faces via Chrome FaceDetector API with a skin-color heuristic fallback. Redacted screenshots are JPEG-compressed at 0.85 quality.
- **Safety Gate** — A single enforcement point runs before every action. The agent refuses to type into password fields, blocks values that match PII patterns, and requires user confirmation for irreversible actions (purchases, deletions, submissions).
- **Deterministic Planner** — Simple tasks resolve without any LLM call: click by text match, fill by label, scroll, navigate, press key. Sub-100ms latency for common form interactions.
- **Multi-Provider LLM Support** — Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Ollama (local). The agent adapts its system prompt size for small local models to avoid context overflow.
- **Loop Detection** — Tracks recent actions and breaks out when the same action repeats beyond a threshold, preventing infinite loops on unresponsive pages.
- **Session History** — Completed tasks are saved to `chrome.storage.local` with transcripts, PII metrics, and duration for later review.

## Privacy Pipeline

Every piece of data that might cross a network boundary goes through a five-stage pipeline before transmission. The pipeline runs at every perception step — initial page load, after every action, and on fresh snapshots.

### Stage 1: DOM Snapshot Sanitization

The content script extracts interactive elements into a `PageSnapshot` — element IDs, roles, names, values, and ARIA attributes. Before this snapshot reaches the LLM:

1. `detectAllPII` scans element values and page text for credential fields, API keys, Aadhaar/PAN/SSN/passport patterns, and card numbers.
2. `tokenizer.tokenizeSnapshot` replaces sensitive values with opaque tokens (`<CRED_1>`, `<ID_2>`). The original values are held in an in-memory vault that is cleared when the task ends.
3. `redactSnapshot` replaces tokenized element values with `[REDACTED]` and page text ID patterns with `[ID_REDACTED]`.
4. The rendered snapshot — what the LLM actually sees — contains only tokens, never raw values.

### Stage 2: Screenshot Redaction

When a screenshot is captured via `captureVisibleTab`:

1. The content script's `getSensitiveRegions` identifies bounding boxes for password fields, credential inputs, card number fields, Aadhaar/PAN/SSN fields, and visible ID text in the DOM.
2. The offscreen document receives the screenshot, sensitive regions, and device pixel ratio.
3. DOM-guided redaction applies solid black masks to high-confidence credential regions and Gaussian blur (12px) to general input fields.
4. Face detection runs via Chrome FaceDetector API, falling back to a skin-color heuristic (RGB + normalized RGB rules across diverse skin tones). Detected faces receive Gaussian blur (20px) with 20% bounding box expansion.
5. The redacted image is converted to JPEG at 0.85 quality.

### Stage 3: Token Resolution

Tokens are resolved back to real values only at the last possible moment — when the agent is about to execute an action. The `resolveTokens` function recursively walks the action input, swapping every `<TYPE_N>` token via the vault. If the LLM returns a token that was never issued by the client, the action is rejected as a potential prompt injection.

### Stage 4: Safety Gate

Every action passes through `gate()` before execution:

- **Credential fields** — The agent refuses to type into any field matching password, CVV, card number, Aadhaar, PAN, SSN, passport, IFSC, OTP, or API key patterns.
- **Sensitive values** — The agent refuses to type text matching API key formats, card numbers, Aadhaar/PAN/SSN patterns, or private keys.
- **Irreversible actions** — Click actions matching purchase, send, delete, submit, confirm, transfer, or sign-up patterns require user confirmation.
- **Form submission** — Typing with `submit: true` into a non-search field requires user confirmation.

### Stage 5: Prompt Injection Detection

Page text is scanned for patterns like "ignore previous instructions", "developer mode", "you are now an AI agent", and "jailbreak". When detected, the agent flags it to the user and treats the text as page content, not as an instruction.

## PII Detection

| PII Type | Detection Method | Precision |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Aadhaar number | 12-digit pattern (XXXX XXXX XXXX) | ~85% (regex only) |
| PAN card | Format validation (ABCDE1234F) | ~90% (format only) |
| IFSC code | Structural pattern (4 letters + 0 + 6 alphanumeric) | ~90% |
| SSN | Format pattern (XXX-XX-XXXX) | ~85% |
| Passport | Format pattern (1-2 letters + 6-8 digits) | ~80% |
| Credit/Debit card | 16-digit pattern with optional separators | ~85% (regex only) |
| Password fields | DOM `input[type=password]` + field name patterns | ~99% |
| API keys | Format patterns for Anthropic, OpenAI, GitHub, Slack, AWS, JWT | ~95% |
| Face | Chrome FaceDetector API + skin-color heuristic | ~90% |
| Phone (Indian) | 10-digit pattern starting with 6-9 | ~80% |
| Email | Standard regex pattern | ~90% |

Detection runs in the service worker for DOM/text PII and in the offscreen document for visual PII (faces). The safety gate provides a second layer of enforcement at action-execution time.

---

## Agent Loop

The agent operates in a perceive-plan-act-verify cycle:

1. **Perceive** — Extract a `PageSnapshot` from the content script. Apply the full privacy pipeline (detect, tokenize, redact). For local models, cap element count to 30 (80 for cloud models).
2. **Plan** — On step 0, the deterministic planner attempts to resolve the task without an LLM. If it fails or the task is complex, the LLM planner (Anthropic/OpenAI/OpenRouter/Ollama) generates tool calls. The system prompt is shorter for local models (`SYSTEM_PROMPT_LOCAL`, ~180 tokens) to avoid context overflow.
3. **Act** — Each tool call passes through the safety gate. Element IDs are validated against the current snapshot. Tokens are resolved from the vault. The action executes via the content script (page actions) or Chrome APIs (navigation, tabs).
4. **Verify** — After any action that may have changed the page, a fresh snapshot is captured. The privacy pipeline runs again. If the agent repeats the same action 3 times within 5 steps, it stops with a loop detection error.

### Provider Adaptation

The agent detects `provider === "ollama"` and applies several adaptations for local models:

- Shorter system prompt (`SYSTEM_PROMPT_LOCAL` vs `SYSTEM_PROMPT`)
- Smaller snapshot element cap (30 vs 80)
- Extended timeouts (120s request, 30s per chunk)
- Tool-calling fallback (retry without tools if model returns 403)

## What is Next

The current implementation provides a functional privacy pipeline for DOM-based PII detection, screenshot redaction, and safe browser automation. The following capabilities would significantly strengthen the product:

### Vision Perception (High Priority)

The agent currently relies entirely on DOM extraction for page understanding. Pages with canvas-rendered content, PDFs, images, or dynamically generated text are invisible to the agent.

- **Florence-2 ViT** — Open-vocab object detection (`<OD>`), OCR with bounding boxes (`<OCR_WITH_REGION>`), and page captioning (`<CAPTION>`) via `@huggingface/transformers` in the offscreen document.
- **PP-OCR** — PaddleOCR detection + recognition via ONNX Runtime Web for lightweight text extraction (18MB model). Supports English and Devanagari.
- **ScreenGraph Fusion** — Combine DOM, OCR, and ViT signals into a unified representation with IoU-based deduplication.

### Checksum-Gated PII Validation (High Priority)

The current detection uses only regex patterns, which produces false positives (e.g., a 10-digit order ID flagged as Aadhaar). Mathematical validation would eliminate most of these:

- **Aadhaar** — Verhoeff checksum algorithm (12-digit mathematical validation)
- **PAN Card** — Format + first-character series validation (validating that the first letter is from the correct series)
- **Credit/Debit Cards** — Luhn algorithm (13-19 digit validation)
- **IFSC Code** — Structural validation with bank code lookup

### Egress Guard (Medium Priority)

A `guardedFetch` wrapper that intercepts every outbound request VLESS itself makes and scans the body with PII detectors before transmission. If checksum-validated PII is found, the request is blocked before it reaches the network.

### MAIN-World Tripwire (Medium Priority)

A separate content script injected into the page's MAIN world that patches `fetch`/`XMLHttpRequest` to observe (not block) which site requests carry PII. Observations feed the privacy audit. This must run in the MAIN world because the content script's isolated world has its own `fetch` — patching it there observes nothing the page does.

### Re-OCR Verification (Medium Priority)

After redacting a screenshot, re-OCR the redacted image and assert that zero PII text remains in the pixels. This proves that redaction actually worked — not a claim, but a measured assertion.

### In-Page PII Badge (Low Priority)

A DOM overlay at the top-center of the page that appears when PII is detected, showing a color-coded breakdown by category (Aadhaar, Phone, PAN, etc.) with a count. Auto-dismisses after 8 seconds. Visible to the user but not in screenshots sent to the LLM.

### Adaptive Prompt Compression (Low Priority)

Dynamically shrink the page snapshot based on remaining context budget. For a model with a 4K context window and a 910-token system prompt, the snapshot should be capped at ~2500 tokens. For a 128K model, it can be much larger. The current approach (hard cap at 30/80 elements) is a coarse approximation.

### Session Replay (Low Priority)

Replay a completed session's transcript step-by-step, showing the snapshot and action at each step. Useful for debugging and demos.
